This repository contains the Simulink model file for the Ball-Beam Controller.
Currently, the controller is PID, running will give the results for the PID controller as stated in the report.

For P controller, change the controller type to P Controller and set: P = 1.19. Run the model and see the results in Display block.

Similarly, for PD controller, change the controller type to PD controller and set: P = 2.37, D = 6.78, N = 653. Run the model and see the results in Display block.
